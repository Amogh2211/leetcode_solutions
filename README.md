# leetcode_solutions
Daily leetcode solutions to overcome unemployment. Starting the list off with the [NeetCode 150](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) list and then will do more after.
I will try to make notes for every solution in a readme that will exist in the corresponding folder, in case it does not exist assume that the notes are in progress or I was just too lazy.

## Setup and how to get it to work
Every solution has the input formatted to take input from 'input.txt' and produce the output to 'output.txt'
Currently the input formatting is very wonky but will get better with time.
